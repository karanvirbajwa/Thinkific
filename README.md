# Thinkific

**Execution:** 
Install Java and set to your environment variables

Install Maven and set to your environment variables
Verify maven is installed by executing "mvn -version" command in cmd

In cmd open project where it is stored 
Execute "mvn clean" command to clean target folder
Execute "mvn test" command to execute test cases 

For execution directly execute test cases by TestRunner file or command line maven

Used Java, Cucumber and Selenium to complete UI task
Used Java, Rest Assured, Json Parser to complete API task
Tried to create framework enhanced as much as possible

**NOTE:** 
1. Used Excel to save the fields fetched from UI and used in API for two different test cases (we can also use static variables or enums for ease but they have limitation to one instance of execution)
2. Completed the tasks mentioned but for search functionality in Instructor section I also covered couple of cases during execution
3. Did not created separated test case in feature for search functionality (we reDo if something required is missing)
